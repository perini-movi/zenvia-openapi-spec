## Instagram sender and recipient

When you receive a message from a contact from instagram channel:

* Recipient: is your instagram account id (this is not your account @)
* Sender: is the contact id on your account (this is not the contact @ and it will differ across accounts)

When you send a message to a contact, the sender and recipient are inverted:

* Recipient: is the contact id on your account (this is not the contact @ and it will differ across accounts)
* Sender: is your instagram account id (this is not your account @)

The sender goes in the attribute `from` and the receiver goes in the attribute `to` of message object.
